      <div class="row">

          Some people say that when you start transitioning your hair you should do a "Big chop".
          A big chop is when you chop all of your off to cut out the damage that came from
          chemicals and heat damage, but the big chop is not for everyone... this is where transitioning
          comes from.
          </p>
          <div></div>
          <p>
          Transitioning is for women who do not necessarily want to cut off most of their hair, but want to achieve healthiness.
          So what they do is let their hair grow out and gradually begin to cut off the damaged ends, while treating their
          hair like its "natural". Its also best if you stray away from heat and use protective styles, such as healthy weaves
          (ones that have limited to no leave out and that won't take off your edges.), braids, twistouts, faux locs and crotchet.

            Once your hair is back to its natural state, you need to make sure you do everything that you did to get it there.
            Stay away from bad chemicals, i.e. relaxers, perms, harmful dyes and bleach. These chemicals will more than likely
            damage your curls and you would have to start over.
            </p>
            <div></div>
            <p>
            If you want to dye your hair its best to do research on dye that does not have parabens, sulfates and mineral oil and
            water should be the number 1 ingredient. This is important for all hair products you use on you hair because damage can occur.
            </p>

            It is important to use hair oil to stimulate hair growth, give hair shine, protection and moisture. It is also important to add good deep
            conditioners and protein treatments to your hair regimen to keep your hair strong and moisturized.
